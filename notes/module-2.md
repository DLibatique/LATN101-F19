## The Imperfect Tense - Conceptual Overview

The **imperfect tense** is one of three different past tenses (along with the perfect and pluperfect) used in Latin. The imperfect is different from the other two tenses because it connotes an ongoing, continuous, habitual, or attempted action in the past (it never refers to a completed action). For instance, for the English verb "do", we would translate the Latin imperfect as "was doing" (the most common translation of the imperfect), "used to do", "kept on doing", or "began to do."

Below are some English examples where we would use the Latin imperfect:

* When I went to the store, she was doing (*faciēbat*) her homework.
* They used to give (*dabant*) the football players free pizza on Friday.
* Although the teacher told them to stop working, the students kept writing (*scrībēbant*) their exams.
* Katie was demanding (*poscēbat*) that they play Beyonce.

## The Imperfect Tense - Formation

To form the imperfect tense, we begin by finding the verb's present stem. To find the present stem, we take the second principal part (the present active infinitive) and chop off the final *-re* .

For instance, in the case of the verb, *videō*, it second principal part is *vidēre* and taking off the *-re* gives us a present stem of *vidē-*.

For verbs that belong to the first and second declension, we do not need to modify the present stem and can simply add *-ba* to it

### Practice Opportunity

Find the present stem and form the 3rd person singular imperfect for the following verbs.
