## The Imperfect Tense - Conceptual Overview

The **imperfect tense** is one of three different past tenses (along with the perfect and pluperfect) used in Latin. The imperfect is different from the other two tenses because it connotes an ongoing, continuous, habitual, or attempted action in the past (it never refers to a completed action). For instance, for the English verb "do", we would translate the Latin imperfect as "was doing" (the most common translation of the imperfect), "used to do", "kept on doing", or "began to do."

Some English examples where we would use the Latin imperfect:

* When I went to the store, she was doing (*faciēbat*) her homework.
* They used to give (*dabant*) the football players free pizza on Friday.
* Although the teacher told them to stop working, the students kept writing (*scrībēbant*) their exams.
* Katie was demanding (*poscēbat*) that they play Beyonce.
