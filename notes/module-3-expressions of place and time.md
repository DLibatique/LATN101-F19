## Prepositional Phrases

In Latin, prepositions (like "in", "into", "with", "to") are indeclinable words that are always followed by a noun in the ablative and accusative (called the **object of the preposition**).

Latin uses prepositional phrases to indicate where or in what direction something is happening.

## Expressions of Place

Below are the ways that Latin expresses ideas of place:

1) Place to which (*ad*, *trans*, or *in* + accusative):
 - Currebat **ad patrem**. ("She was running towards her father.")
 - Venit **in urbem**. ("He came into the city")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rus* ("countryside"), Latin uses the accusative without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind for now.

2) Place where (*in* or *pro* + ablative):
* Hercules **in regno** Thesei vixit. ("Hercules lived in the kingdom of Theseus.")
* Milites **pro castris** pugnabant. ("The soldiers were fighting in front of the camps.")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rus* ("countryside"), Latin uses the **locative case** without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind for now.

3) Place from which (*a/ab* or *e/ex* + ablative):
* Puella **ab urbe** fugiebat ("The girl was fleeing from the city.")
* Navis **ex porto** navigavit ("The ship sailed away from the port.")

4) Accusative of extent of space (no preposition):
* Puer **quinque pedes** altus est. ("The boy is five feet tall.")

## Expressions of Time

Below are the ways that Latin expresses ideas of time:

1) Length of time in the accusative (no preposition):
* **Quattour annos** in illa urbe laboravit. ("They worked for four years in that city").
* **Quinque menses** pro templo vixerunt. ("They lived in front of the temple for five months.").

2) Time when in the ablative (no preposition):
* **Illa nocte** puella ab agris cucurrit. ("On that night, the girl ran from the fields.")
* Navis **prima luce** ex insula navigavit. ("The ship sailed away from the island at first light.")

3) Time within which (no preposition):
* **Primo anno** regni Carthaginem vicit. ("In the first year of his reign, he conquered Carthage").
* **Quinque horis** ad urbem venerunt. ("Within five hours, they arrived at the city.")
