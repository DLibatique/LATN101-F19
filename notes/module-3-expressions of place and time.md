## Prepositional Phrases

Latin uses prepositional phrases to indicate where or in what direction something is happening.

## Expressions of Place

Below are the ways that Latin expresses ideas of place:

1) Place to which (*ad* or *in* + accusative):
 - Currebat **ad patrem**. ("She was running towards her father.")
 - Venit **in urbem**. ("He came into the city")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rus* ("countryside"), Latin uses the accusative without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind for now.

2) Place where (*in* or *pro* + ablative):
* Hercules **in regno** Thesei vixit. ("Hercules lived in the kingdom of Theseus.")
* Milites **pro castris** pugnabant. ("The soldiers were fighting in front of the camps.")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rus* ("countryside"), Latin uses the **locative case** without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind for now.

3) Place from which (*a/ab* or *e/ex* + ablative):
* Puella **ab urbe** fugiebat ("The girl was fleeing from the city.")
* Navis **ex porto** navigavit ("The ship sailed away from the port.")

4) Accusative of extent of space:
* Puer **quinque pedes** altus est. ("The boy is five feet tall.")
