## Prepositional Phrases

In Latin, **prepositions** (like "in", "into", "with", "to", English) are indeclinable words followed by a noun in the ablative or accusative (called the **object of the preposition**). This unit consisting of preposition and the object of the preposition is called a **prepositional phrase**.

Prepositional phrases add more information about the main action of the sentence by answering questions like where, why, which, and how:

* Puellam **in urbe** vīdit. ("She saw the girl in the city.") (**Where** did she see the girl? In the city.)
* **Ob īgnem** fugiēbat. ("He was fleeing because of the fire.") (**Why** was he fleeing? Because of the fire.)
* Hercules **cum quattuor sagittīs** monstra necāvit. ("Hercules killed the monsters with three arrows.) (**With what** did Hercules kill the monsters? With four arrows.)

<!--
last example -- this would be an ablative of means, without *cum*, right? Maybe better: Hercules killed the monsters under the bridge, Hercules monstra sub ponte necāvit)
-->

## Expressions of Place

Latin uses the accusative and ablative case, frequently with prepositions, to express ideas related to space and place.

Below are the different expressions of place used in Latin:

1) Place to which (*ad*, *trāns*, or *in* + accusative):
- Currēbat **ad pātrem**. ("She was running towards her father.")
- Vēnit **in urbem**. ("He came into the city.")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rūs* ("countryside"), Latin uses the accusative without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind.

2) Place where (*in* or *prō* + ablative):
* Hercules **in rēgnō** Theseī vīxit. ("Hercules lived in the kingdom of Theseus.")
* Mīlitēs **prō castris** pugnābant. ("The soldiers were fighting in front of the camps.")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rūs* ("countryside"), Latin uses the **locative case** without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind..

3) Place from which (*ā/ab* or *ē/ex* + ablative):
* Puella **ab urbe** fugiēbat. ("The girl was fleeing from the city.")
* Nāvis **ex portō** nāvigāvit. ("The ship sailed away from the port.")

4) Accusative of extent of space (no preposition):
* Puer **quīnque pedes** altus est. ("The boy is five feet tall.")

## Expressions of Time

The accusative and ablative cases (without prepositions) can also be used to express ideas related to time.

Below are the ways that Latin expresses ideas of time:

1) Length of time in the accusative (no preposition):
* **Quattour annōs** in illā urbe labōrāvit. ("They worked for four years in that city").
* **Quīnque mēnsēs** prō templō vīxērunt. ("They lived in front of the temple for five months.").

2) Time when in the ablative (no preposition):
* **Illā nocte** puella ab agrīs cucurrit. ("On that night, the girl ran from the fields.")
* Nāvis **primā lūce** ex insulā nāvigāvit. ("The ship sailed away from the island at first light.")

3) Time within which (no preposition):
* **Primō annō** regnī Carthāginem vīcit. ("In the first year of his reign, he conquered Carthage").
* **Quīnque horīs** ad urbem vēnērunt. ("Within five hours, they arrived at the city.")
