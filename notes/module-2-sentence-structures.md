## <a name="sentpat">Sentence Patterns</a>

Translating Latin sentences becomes much easier if you can recognize certain structural patterns that tell us what to expect in a sentence. Key to identifying what structural pattern a sentence follows is the main verb. The type of verb that appears in the sentence tells us what other grammatical items we need to fill out the rest of the sentence.

Below you will find a discussion of several very common sentence structures as well as guidelines for how to distinguish them by looking at the verb.

### <a name="intrans">Intransitive Sentences</a>

**Intransitive sentences** feature a subject and an **intransitive verb**. An intransitive verb is a verb that expresses an action, but does not act directly upon an object (e.g. sneezing, dancing, running, raining, etc.). As a result, an intransitive verb (and, thus, an intransitive sentence) does not take a direct object.

Below are some examples of intransitive sentences in Latin and English:

* Puella cucurrit. ("The girl ran.")
* Timent. ("They are frightened.")

NB: It might tempting to think that the sentence "The girl ran three miles" has a direct object. However, "three miles" is the shortened form of "for three miles", an adverbial phrase that describes the word "ran."

To summarize, intransitive sentences must have a:
* Subject
* Intransitive active verb

### <a name="trans">Transitive Sentences</a>

**Transitive sentences** require a **direct object**, in addition to a subject and verb to complete the meaning of the sentence.

For example, let's consider the verb *facere* ("to make" in English). If I were to say *agricola fēcit* - "the farmer made", the sentence would feel incomplete. You would be thinking what is the making. Pizza? Cake? A fence?

Thus, we need to add a direct object to tell us what the farmer was making. In English, we would indicate this by putting what the farmer made immediately after the verb (e.g. "the farmer made pizza"). However, because Latin is an inflected language whose word order is highly variable, we can't do this. Rather, Latin indicates that a noun is functioning as a direct object by putting it in the **accusative case** (be sure to become familiar with the accusative endings for nouns and adjectives in Module 1). Thus, the Latin version of the sentence looks like this:

Agricola ***pizzam*** fecit.

Below are some further examples of transitive sentences with accusative direct objects:

* Pater **fīliam** amāvit ("The father loved his daughter.")
* Fīliī **matres** amant. ("The sons love their mother.")
* **Agricolam** eius uxor iuvābat. ("The wife was helping her farmer.")
* Fortis vir **magnum monstrum** et **terribilem serpentem** pugnābat. ("The brave man is fighting the great monster and the terrible serpent.")

Sometimes, you will want to specify the recipient of the action of the verb. For instance, in the sentence "the farmer gave the girl a pizza", the girl receives the pizza that the farmer gives. Pizza is still the direct object - the farmer is giving the pizza (not the girl). In this sentence, the word "girl" is what is referred to as an **indirect object**, the recipient of the action done by the main verb. In Latin, we signal the indirect object by using the **dative case** (be sure to become familiar with these forms by looking at the chart for Module 1), which we usually translate as "to/for X". So in Latin "the farmer gave the girl a pizza" looks like this:

* Agricola pizzam **puellae** dedit.

To summarize, transitive sentences must have a:
* Subject
* Active verb
* Direct object in the accusative

And sometimes have an:
* Indirect object in the dative

### <a name="pass">Passive Sentences</a>

**Passive sentences** feature a subject and, unsurprisingly a passive verb. Because the subject of a passive verb is being acted upon, passive sentences do not feature a direct object. Below are some examples of simple passive sentences:

* Puella visa est. ("The girl was seen.")
* Viri capti sunt. ("The men were captured.")

Sometimes, passive sentences feature a construction known as the **ablative of agent** which tells us who did the action of the main verb (since the subject is being acted upon). We can recognize the ablative of agent by the preposition a/ab followed by a noun in the ablative case (be sure to investigate what the ablative looks like). Below are the simple passive sentences with an ablative of agent:

* Puella **ab matre** visa est. ("The girl was seen by her mother.")
* Virī **a fēminīs** captī sunt. ("The men were captured by women.")

Passive sentences can also feature an indirect object in the dative case as well. For example, we might see a sentence like the following:

* Pizza **puellae** data est. ("The pizza was given to the girl.")

To summarize, passive sentences must have a:
* Subject
* Passive verb

And sometimes have an:
* An ablative of agent
* Indirect object in the dative

#### Practice exercise

Form the ablative singular and plural of the following words using the charts from Module 1.

### <a name="link">Linking Sentences</a>

**Linking sentences**, which we have already met, require a subject, linking verb, and predicate nominative which matches the subject in number and case. The most common linking verb in English and Latin is "to be" (*sum*, *esse*, *fui*, *futurus*), though there are other linking verb we will see throughout the semester. Below are some examples of linking sentences:

* Vir pater est. ("The man is a father.")
* Puellae magnī et fortes agriolae sunt. ("The girls are strong and brave farmers.")

To summarize, linking sentences must have a:
* Subject
* Linking verb
* Predicate nominative

## <a name="tips">Tips for Determining Sentence Structure</a>

The most important thing to do when determining sentence structure is to look at the main verb. If the verb is passive, we know that the sentence structure is going to be passive; if the verb is a linking verb (i.e. a form of *sum*), then we know the sentence structure is going to be linking. It is more difficult to differentiate between transitive and intransitive verbs. While some Latin verbs are used only transitively (verbs like "to carry") and or only intransitively (verbs to "rain"), a large number of verbs can be used both transitively or intransitively. In these cases, you will want to see if there is a direct object in the accusative case (transitive) or not (intransitive).

### Practice Opportunities

Determine the sentence structure of the following sentences. What nouns or adjectives in these sentences are in the dative, accusative, or ablative case?
