## General notes on Latin sentences

In English, word order .  For example, "the cat hits the dog" is different in meaning that "the dog hits the cat." In the first sentence, it is the cat that is acting upon . subject verb object.

As discussed before, Latin, unlike English, does not have a set word order. So If we can figure out what type of sentence we have by looking at the verb, then we can get a sense of what to expect.

## Intransitive sentences

**Intransitive sentences** feature a subject and an **intransitive verb**. An intransitive verb is a verb that expresses an action, but does not act directly upon an object (e.g. sneezing, dancing, running, raining, etc.). As a result, an intransitive verb (and, thus, an intransitive sentence) does not take a direct object.

Below are some examples of intransitive sentences in Latin and English:

* Puella cucurrit. ("The girl ran.")
* Timent. ("They are frightened.")

NB: It might tempting to think that the sentence "The girl ran three miles" has a direct object. However, "three miles" is the shortened form of "for three miles", an adverbial phrase that describes the word "ran."

To summarize, intransitive sentences must have:
* Subject
* Intransitive verb

## Transitive sentences

**Transitive sentences** require a **direct object**, in addition to a subject and verb to complete the meaning of the sentence.

For example, let's consider the verb *facere* ("to make" in English). If I were to say *agricola fecit* - "the farmer made", the sentence would feel incomplete. You would be thinking what is the making. Pizza? Cake? A fence?

Thus, we need to add a direct object to tell us what the farmer was making. In English, we would indicate this by putting what the farmer made immediately after the verb (e.g. "the farmer made pizza"). However, because Latin is an inflected language whose word order is highly variable, we can't do this. Rather, Latin indicates that a noun is functioning as a direct object by putting it in the **accusative case** (be sure to become familiar with the accusative endings for nouns and adjectives in ). Thus, the Latin version of the sentence looks like this:

Agricola ***pizzam*** fecit.

Below are some further examples of transitive sentences with accusative direct objects:

Pater **filiam** amavit ("The father loved his daughter.")
Filii **matres** amant. ("The sons love their mother.")
Agricolam eius uxor iuvabat. ("The wife was helping her farmer.")
Fortis vir magnum monstrum et terribilem serpentem pugnabat. ("The brave man is fighting the great monster and the terrible serpent.")

Sometimes, you will want to specify for the recipient of the action of the verb. For instance, in "her father gave her a pizza"  . Her is what is referred to as an **indirect object**. In Latin, we signal that

To summarize, transitive sentences must have an:
* Subject
* Verb
* Direct object in the accusative

And sometimes have an:
* Indirect object in the dative

## Passive Sentences

**Passive sentences** feature a subject and, unsurprisingly a passive verb. Because the subject of a passive verb is being acted upon, passive sentences do not feature a direct object. Below are some examples of simple passive sentences:

Puella visa est. ("The girl was seen.")
Viri capti sunt. ("The men were captured.")

Sometimes, passive sentences feature a construction known as the **ablative of agent** which tells us who did the action of the main verb (since the subject is being acted upon). We can recognize the ablative of agent by the preposition a/ab followed by a noun in the ablative case (be sure to investigate what the ablative looks like). Below are the simple passive sentences with an ablative of agent:

Puella **ab matre** visa est. ("The girl was seen by her mother.")
Viri **a feminis** capti sunt. ("The men were captured by women.")

## Linking Sentence

**Linking sentences**, which we have already met, require a subject, linking verb, and predicate nominative which matches the subject in number and case. The most common linking verb in English and Latin is "to be" (*sum*, *esse*, *fui*, *futurus*), though there are other linking verb we will see throughout the semester. Below are some examples of linking sentences:

Vir pater est. ("The man is a father.")
Puellae magni et fortes agriolae sunt. ("The girls are strong and brave farmers.")

## Tips for Determining Sentence Structure

The most important thing to do when determining sentence structure is to look at the main verb. If the verb is passive, we know that the sentence structure is going to be passive; if the verb is a linking verb (i.e. a form of *sum*), then we know the sentence structure is going to be linking. It is more difficult to differentiate between transitive and intransitive verbs. While some Latin verbs are used only transitively (verbs like "to carry") and or only intransitively (verbs to "rain"), a large number of verbs can be used both transitively or intransitively. In these cases, you will want to see if there is a direct object in the accusative case (transitive) or not (intransitive).
