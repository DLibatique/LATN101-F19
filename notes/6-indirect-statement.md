## Indirect Statement

In English, there are two ways to report what someone says. We can report it **directly** by using quotations or we can report it **indirectly** by paraphrasing it. Consider the following examples:

- Direct Statement: The students said: "We like Latin."
- Indirect Statement: The students said **that** they like Latin.

- Direct Statement: She said: "Pizza is the best food."
- Indirect Statement: She said **that** pizza is the best food.

How we differentiate between what someone actually said and a paraphrase of what they said in Latin? The answer is that we change the form that we use for the subject and main verb of the statement. When we replicate what was actually said, we follow the nominative subject and finite verb pattern that we have already met this semester:

- Dixit: “pater amavit filias.”

- He said: "The father loved his daughters."

To indicate that we are paraphrasing what the speaker said, we use the accusative to represent the subject of the thought and an infinitive as a main verb:

- Dixit patrem amare filias.

- He said **that** the father loved his daughters.

Thus, we can recognize **indirect statement** by the use of **accusative subject** and an **infinitive** following the sentence's main verb. While the main verb in these constructions is a verb of speaking, indirect statements in Latin can also be introduced by what is known as a **verb of the head**, a verb for any action you can do with your head (i.e speaking, thinking, perceiving, believing, seeing, agreeing).

- Credidit patrem amare filias.
