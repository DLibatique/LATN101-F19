## Prepositional Phrases

In Latin, **prepositions** (like "in", "into", "with", "to", English) are indeclinable words followed by a noun in the ablative and accusative (called the **object of the preposition**). This unit consisting of preposition and the object of the preposition is called a **prepositional phrase**.

Prepositional phrases add more information about the main action of the sentence by answering questions like where, why, and how:

* Puellam **in urbe** vīdit. ("She saw the girl in the city.")
* **Ob īgnem** fugiēbat. ("He was fleeing because of the fire.")
* Hercules **cum quattuor sagittīs** necāvit. ("Hercules killed the monsters with three arrows."")

## Expressions of Place

Latin uses the accusative and ablative case, frequently with prepositions, to express ideas related to space and place.

Below are the different expressions of place used in Latin:

1) Place to which (*ad*, *trāns*, or *in* + accusative):
 - Currēbat **ad pātrem**. ("She was running towards her father.")
 - Vēnit **in urbem**. ("He came into the city")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rūs* ("countryside"), Latin uses the accusative without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind for now.

2) Place where (*in* or *prō* + ablative):
* Hercules **in rēgnō** Theseī vīxit. ("Hercules lived in the kingdom of Theseus.")
* Mīlitēs **prō castris** pugnābant. ("The soldiers were fighting in front of the camps.")

NB: In the case of cities, small towns, and the words *domus* ("home") and *rūs* ("countryside"), Latin uses the **locative case** without a preposition. No need to worry about this now, but just something to keep in mind for now.

3) Place from which (*ā/ab* or *ē/ex* + ablative):
* Puella **ab urbe** fugiēbat ("The girl was fleeing from the city.")
* Nāvis **ex portō** nāvigāvit ("The ship sailed away from the port.")

4) Accusative of extent of space (no preposition):
* Puer **quīnque pedes** altus est. ("The boy is five feet tall.")
