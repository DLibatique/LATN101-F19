## <a name="nouns">Nouns</a>

Latin nouns have three characteristics: **grammatical gender**, **number**, and **case**.

**Grammatical gender** is not related to biological gender (though at times they can align), but it is a classification system that allows us to determine what form the modifying adjective should take (more on this below). Nouns can be one of three of genders: **masculine**, **feminine**, or **neuter**. A noun's gender cannot be changed.

**Number** tells us whether the noun in question is **singular** or **plural**. Consequently, it also plays a role in determining the form the modifying adjective may take (more on this below). When nouns function as the subject of the sentence, number also helps us to determine the proper verb form to use (subject-verb agreement). This works exactly like English.

**Case** indicates the function of a noun in the sentence. Because Latin is an inflected language, it does not rely on word order to indicate how a word functions in a sentence. Rather, the endings of the noun will change to reflect what it is doing in the sentence - whether it is a subject or direct object or the object of preposition etc. Again, it will also provide information about the form that the modifying adjective must take (more on this below). Nouns can be one of six cases: **nominative**, **genitive**, **dative**, **accusative**, **ablative**, or **vocative**.

To summarize, nouns have:

- Grammatical Gender
  * Feminine
  * Masculine
  * Neuter
- Number
  * Singular
  * Plural
- Case
  * Nominative
  * Genitive
  * *Dative (Week 2)*
  * *Accusative (Week 2)*
  * *Ablative (Week 2)*
  * *Vocative (Week 6)*

How can we determine what characteristics that a noun "in the wild" has? We need to consult what we call the **dictionary entry** (that is how the noun will appear in a dictionary). Below we have the dictionary entry for *mater*:

*mater*, *matris*, f. - mother

Working from left to right, *mater* indicates what the **nominative singular** form of the word is.

*Matris* indicates the **genitive singular** form of the word. This form tells two important pieces of information. First, it provides the **stem** (*matr-*) that is used to create all cases and numbers of the noun in question except for the nominative singular. Second, the ending, in this example *-is*, tells us the pattern (often referred to as a **declension**) that the noun will follow in creating different cases and numbers (more below).

Next, we have grammatical **gender**, signified here by the "f", that tells us that *mater* is feminine. As mentioned above, this is an immutable characteristic.

The last part of the dictionary entry is simply the definition.

## <a name="declensions">Declensions</a>

As I alluded to above, Latin is an inflected language and relies on word endings to reveal how a word functions within the sentence. The way that Latin nouns or adjectives change their endings to reflect their function in a sentence is what we call a **declension**. There are three major declensions (as well as two minor ones) that we will become familiar with.

The declension to which a noun belongs can be easily determined by consulting the genitive singular form in dictionary entry:
- If the genitive singular entry ends in ***-ae***, then the noun belongs to what we call the **first declension** (e.g *fīlia*, *fīliae*, f. - daughter).

- If the genitive singular entry ends in ***-ī***, then the noun belongs to what we call the **second declension** (e.g *fīlius*, *fīliī*, m. - son). NOTE: The nominative singular forms of second declension masculine nouns can end either in *-us* (e.g., *fīlius*) or *-r* (e.g., *puer*, *ager*). Nevertheless, the genitive singulars of these nouns ends in -ī, so they belong to the second declension!

- If the genitive singular entry ends in ***-is***, then the noun belongs to what we call the **third declension** (e.g *pater*, *patris*, m. - father).

### Practice opportunity

Look at the nouns which you have been assigned and determine to which declension it belongs.

## <a name="adjectives">Adjectives</a>

Adjectives modify (i.e. tell us more about) nouns. In Latin, adjectives must agree with nouns in **number**, **case**, and **gender**. Thus, a feminine nominative singular noun must be modified by the feminine nominative singular form of the adjective, while a masculine nominative singular noun is modified by a masculine nominative singular adjective. For instance:

*magnus pater* ("great father"; masculine singular nominative)  
*magna mater* ("great mother"; feminine singular nominative)  
*magni patrēs* ("great fathers"; masculine plural nominative)  
*magnae patrēs* ("great mothers"; feminine plural nominative)  

Because adjective need to match nouns in form, they also decline in gender, case, and number (NB: however, adjectives and nouns do not have to belong to the same declension) and fall into one of three declensions (more on this below). Just like nouns, the dictionary entries for adjectives tells us what declension(s) they belong to and, thus, how to form them. Dictionary entries for adjectives come in four types:

**1) <a name="212">The 2-1-2 adjectives:</a>**

Examples:
- *magnus*, *magna*, *magnum* - great
- *bonus*, *bona*, *bonum* - good

The 2-1-2 adjective can be recognized from endings of all three entries (-us, -a, -um or -r, -a, -um). The three forms listed tells us the nominative singular form for all three genders - masculine, feminine, and neuter (from left to right).  

The declension of these adjectives is relatively simple. To get the adjective's stem, you take the -a off the feminine singular form and then add the appropriate endings onto it. If you need a masculine form, then you decline the adjective like a 2nd declension masculine noun (e.g., *maritus*). If you need a feminine form, you decline it like a 1st declension feminine noun (e.g., *puella*). If you need a neuter form, you decline it like a 2nd declension neuter noun (e.g., *exemplum*).

**2) <a name="3term">Three termination adjectives:</a>**

*ācer*, *ācris*, *ācre* - sharp, harsh

Three termination adjectives can be recognized by the fact that they have three adjectival forms, but do not follow the -us, -a, -um or -r, -a, -um pattern that we saw in 2-1-2 adjectives. The dictionary entry for three termination adjectives similarly tells us the nominative singular forms for each gender: *ācer* is the masculine nominative singular form; *ācris* is the feminine nominative singular form; *ācre* is the neuter nominative singular form.

Generally, these adjectives decline like third declension nouns (using the feminine nominative minus the -is as the stem) with a few small differences. The genitive plural for all third declension adjectives ends in *-ium* instead of *-um* and the nominative plural for neuter third declension adjectives ends in *-ia* instead of *-a* (NB: the ablative singular for all third declension adjectives ends with *-i* instead of *-e*, but we don't have to worry about that for now).

**3) <a name="2term">Two termination adjectives:</a>**

*fortis*, *forte* - strong

Two termination adjectives can be recognized by the fact that they have two adjectival forms that end in *-is* and *-e*, respectively. In two termination adjectives, the first form (i.e. *fortis*) tells us the masculine AND feminine nominative singular form and the second form (i.e. *forte*) is the neuter nominative  singular form.

Like three termination adjectives, two termination adjectives generally decline like third declension nouns except in the genitive plural for all genders and neuter nominative plural (as well as the ablative singular).

**4) <a name="1term">One termination adjectives:</a>**

*ferox*, *ferocis* - ferocious

One termination adjectives can be recognized by the *-is* ending in the second part of the dictionary entry. In the dictionary entry for one termination adjectives, the first form (i.e. *ferox*) signifies the nominative singular for all three genders and the second form (i.e. *ferocis*) signifies the genitive singular for all three genders. Like three and two termination adjectives, one termination adjectives generally decline like third declension nouns except in the genitive plural for all genders and neuter nominative plural (as well as the ablative singular).

Beyond these categories, there are few common adjectival forms that are declined irregularly. These include demonstrative adjectives like *hic, haec, hoc* and *ille, illa, illud* (adjectives that point out what you are referring to, equivalent to the English "this" and "that") and the intensifying adjective *ipse, ipsa, ipsum* (adjectives that emphasize the noun they modify, equivalent to the English "the *very* girl" or "the girl *herself*"). You must become familiar with how they decline so that you can recognize them easily when you are reading a Latin text, so please refer to the morphological worksheet for further clarification.

### <a name="substantives">Substantives</a>

One final note on adjectives. At times, they can be used effectively as nouns, which we refer to as **substantival** use of the adjective. You will recognize the substantival use of an adjective by the fact that there will be no noun with which it agrees. To fill out the meaning, we simple add "men", "women", "people", or "things" to the meaning of the adjective depending on the gender. So *bonī* can stand in for "good men" and *bonae* for "good women." This is something that we will return to throughout the semester.

## <a name="case-usages">Case usages - Nominative and Genitive</a>

For the current module, we will focus only on two of the six cases: the **nominative** and the **genitive**. The **nominative** case is used to signal that a noun is the subject of a sentence or is equivalent to the subject of the sentence. For an example of the latter, we can think of the Latin sentence: *mater est femina* ("the mother is a woman"). Both *mater* and *femina* are in the nominative. *Mater* is the subject of the verb *est* and so is in the nominative case. *Femina* is also in the nominative case because it is equivalent with the subject *mater* in this sentence. The usage, which occurs with a linking verb (e.g. "is" in English, "*est*" in Latin), is referred to as the **predicate nominative**.

Nouns in the **genitive** case are used to modify another noun and will always appear next to that noun. Like adjectives, they provide further information about that noun. The genitive is almost always translated with "of" plus the word in the genitive. Examples of the usage of the genitive include:

*fīlius patris* (the son of the father)
*nullus familiae* (none of the family)

<hr>

## <a name="pronouns">Pronouns - *is, ea, id*</a>

Sometimes, Latin uses pronouns to stand in for nouns. The most common Latin pronoun is *is, ea, id* ("he", "she", "it"). The dictionary entry for *is, ea, id* represents the nominative singular forms for all three genders (once again, masculine, feminine, and neuter from left to right).

The pronoun used in place of the noun must have the same gender and number as the original nouns. For instance, you would use *ea* to substitute for *mater* and *is* to subsitute for *pater*. This also applies for nouns that are not typically biologically gendered. For the Latin word for table (*mensa*), you would use *ea* as the pronoun because the noun is feminine.

The declension for the pronoun is tricky, so be sure to consult the morphological tables so you are able to recognize its forms.
