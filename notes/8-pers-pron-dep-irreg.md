## Personal Pronouns

The **personal pronouns** are used to indicate the subject of a sentence. We've dealt with this concept extensively as we learned how to conjugate verbs, and we've been using the personal pronouns in English translations of verbs. For example, as we translate *amāmus* as "**we** love", "we" serves as a personal pronoun. These pronouns can also occur in other cases: for example, as an accusative direct object: "He loves **us**."

The personal pronouns are primarily used in the oblique cases (genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative). We can explicitly state a nominative personal pronoun in Latin, but because the person and number of the **verb** indicates the subject, we normally only use an explicit personal pronoun in the nominative for the purposes of **emphasis** or **differentiation from another subject**.

There are three personal pronouns, each corresponding to the **person** of a verb (1st, 2nd, and 3rd person). Each of these pronouns can be **singular** (I, me, you, he/she/it, him/her/it) or **plural** (we, us, you all, they, them).

The 1st person personal pronoun is *ego* (singular), *nōs* (plural).  
The 2nd person personal pronoun is *tū* (singular), *vōs* (plural).  
The 3rd person personal pronoun is *is, ea, id*, which we've seen and used many times at this point.

The declension charts for these personal pronouns can be found [here](../../charts/0-pronoun-master/#personal).

Take a look at the following examples of the personal pronouns in context:

- *ducēs nōs regēbant.* The leaders were ruling **us**.
- *tibi carmina canam.* I will sing songs **to you**.
- *ab eīs urbs vidēbitur.* The city will be seen by **them**.

## Reflexive Pronouns

When a pronoun in a non-nominative case refers back to the subject of the sentence, we call this a reflexive pronoun (from the Latin verb *reflectere* "to turn back"). In English, reflexive are usually translated as with the suffix -selves:

- I love *myself*.
- You teach *yourself* Latin.
- I gave a present to *myself*.
- They helped *themselves*.

For first and second person pronouns in Latin, the form of the reflexive pronoun is the *same* as the [personal pronoun](https://dlibatique.github.io/LATN101-F19/notes/8-pers-pron-dep-irreg/#personal-pronouns). Below are some examples:

- *mē* amō. ("I love *myself*.")
- *tē* amās. ("You love *yourself*.")
- *vōbīs* donum datis. ("You all are giving a gift to *yourselves".)
- *nōs* īuvāmus. ("We help ourselves.")

Things get a little trickier in the case of the third person pronoun. While there is no ambiguity in first and second pronouns (that is, "I"/"me" and "you" are always self-explanatory), there can be ambiguity in the third person pronoun (there are lots of possible hims and hers). As a result, Latin like English differentiates between the regular pronoun (is, ea, id) and the reflexive (sui = genitive, sibi = dative, sē = accusative, sē = ablative):

- Amat eam. ("She loves her.")
- Amat sē. ("She loves herself.")
- Donum eī dat. ("He gives a gift to him (i.e. a person other than himself).")
- Donum sibi dat. ("He give a gift to himself.")

Interestingly, the same forms are used for the 3rd person plural reflexive pronoun (sui = genitive, sibi = dative, sē = accusative, sē = ablative):. This is because all reflexives refer back to their subject and thus there is no ambiguity between singular and plural.

- Amat sē. ("She loves herself.")
- Amant sē. ("They love themselves.")

## Practice Opportunities

Identify the pronoun and state whether it is reflexive or personal in the following sentences.

1. Feminae sibi dona dedērunt.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac1')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac1">sibi; reflexive</span>

2. Feminae eīs dona dedērunt.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac2')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac2">eīs; personal</span>

3. Virī ab mē cucurrērunt. <button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac3')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac3">mē; personal</span>

4. Nōs iuvāmus. <button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac4')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac4">nōs; reflexive</span>

5. Virī nōs iuvāre poterat. <button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac5')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac5">nōs; personal</span>

## Deponent Verbs

**Deponent verbs** are verbs that are **passive in form, but active in meaning**. That means that although we will conjugate the verb only in the passive voice, when we translate it, we will translate it **actively**. As such, deponents can act like intransitive or transitive verbs, the latter in the sense that they can take a direct object. For example:

- *ducem sequimur.* We are following the leader.

You can tell what verbs are deponent based on their **dictionary entry**. Deponent verbs will have only **three** principal parts; these will correspond to the first three principal parts of a regular verb, except that the forms will be passive. Take a look at this sample 1st conjugation deponent verb:

- hortor, hortārī, hortātus sum - to exhort

*hortor*, although 1st singular present *passive* indicative in form, is translated actively as "I exhort." *hortārī*, although a present *passive* infinitive in form, is translated actively as "to exhort." *hortātus sum*, although 1st singular perfect *passive* indicative in form, is translated actively as "I exhorted" or "I have exhorted."

We must be able to identify deponent verbs from regular verbs because the difference in translation is vast! Take a look at the following examples of deponent verbs used in context:

- *montem magnum mirābantur.* They were marveling at the large mountain.
- *ignem ferōcem verēmur.* We fear the fierce fire.
- *nauta ā navī proficiscitur.* The sailor departs from the ship.

## Irregular Verbs

There are a number of **irregular verbs** in Latin, in the sense that their conjugation patterns often do not follow the normal rules or regular patterns that we've been learning for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 3rd -iō, and 4th conjugation verbs. We've encountered two irregular verbs so far (*sum* and *possum*); here, we introduce 5 more.

- eō, īre, īvī/iī, ītus - to go
- ferō, ferre, tūlī, lātus - to bear, carry
- volō, velle, voluī - to want, wish
- nōlō, nolle, noluī - not to want
- mālō, malle, maluī - to prefer

The conjugation patterns for these five verbs can be found [here](../../charts/0-irreg-verb-master).

Some general comments on memorizing the forms:
- The perfect system tenses (perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect) and the imperfect subjunctive of these verbs are mostly formed completely regularly.
  - The exceptions are the **2nd person singular and plural perfect active indicative** of *eō*, which smushes the expected two i's formed by the stem + ending (iistī, iistis) into a single i, resulting in the forms *īstī* and *īstis*. A similar smushing occurs for all forms of the **pluperfect active subjunctive** of *eō*: *īssem, īssēs, īsset...*; and the perfect active infinitive (*īsse*).
- The present tense of each of these verbs is the most irregular and requires the most attention.
- The only verb in this list that has a passive voice is *ferō*; its present passive conjugation is particularly irregular.
- The imperfect is formed relatively regularly, except on unexpected stems. For example, the imperfect stem for *volō* is *volē-*, to which you attach the *-ba-* infix and the personal endings.
- The future of *eō* uses 1st/2nd conjugation future endings (-bō, -bis, -bit, -bimus, -bitis, -bunt) on the stem *ī-*.
- The future of *ferō*, *volō*, *nōlō*, and *mālō* use 3rd/4th/3rd -iō future endings (-am, -ēs, -et, -ēmus, -ētis, -ent) on irregular stems (ferre > fer-; velle > vol-; nōlle > nōl-; malle > mal-).
- *eō* and *ferō* conjugate in the present subjunctive like 3rd conjugation verbs (with the vowel *ā* and the personal endings) on the stems *e-* and *fer-* respectively. (e.g., *eam, eās, eat...* and *feram, ferās, ferat...*).
- *volō*, *nōlō*, and *mālō* conjugate in the present subjunctive on irregular stems (velle > vel-; nolle > nol-; malle > mal-) with the unusual vowel *-ī-* plus the personal endings. (e.g., *velim, velīs, velit...*; *nōlim, nōlīs, nolit...*; *mālim, mālīs, mālit...*).
