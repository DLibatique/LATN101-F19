## Sentence Patterns

Translating Latin sentences becomes much easier if you can recognize certain structural patterns that tell us what to expect in a sentence. Key to identifying what structural pattern a sentence follows is the **main verb**. The type of verb that appears in the sentence tells us what other grammatical items we need to fill out the rest of the sentence.

Below you will find a discussion of several very common sentence structures as well as guidelines for how to distinguish them by looking at the verb.

### Intransitive Sentences

**Intransitive sentences** feature a subject and an **intransitive verb**. An intransitive verb is a verb that expresses an action or state of being, but does not act directly upon an object: for example, sneezing, dancing, running, raining, etc. As a result, an intransitive verb (and, thus, an intransitive sentence) does not take a direct object (on which, see [Transitive Sentences](#transitive-sentences) below).

Below are some examples of intransitive sentences in Latin and English:

* Puella cucurrit. ("The girl ran.")
* Timent. ("They are frightened.")

NB: It might tempting to think that the sentence "The girl ran three miles" has a direct object. However, "three miles" is the shortened form of "for three miles", an adverbial phrase that describes the word "ran."

To summarize, intransitive sentences must have a:
* Subject
* Intransitive active verb

### Transitive Sentences

**Transitive sentences** require a **direct object**, in addition to a subject and verb to complete the meaning of the sentence.

For example, let's consider the verb *facere* ("to make" in English). If I were to say *agricola fēcit* - "the farmer made", the sentence would feel incomplete. You would be thinking, "What is he making? Pizza? Cake? A fence?""

Thus, we need to add a **direct object** to tell us what the farmer was making. In English, we would indicate this by putting what the farmer made immediately after the verb (e.g., "the farmer made pizza"). However, because Latin is an *inflected* language whose word order is highly variable, we can't do this. Rather, Latin indicates that a noun is functioning as a direct object by putting it in the **accusative case**. Thus, the Latin version of the sentence looks like this:

Agricola ***pizzam*** fecit.

Head to the [noun paradigm charts](../../charts/1-nouns) and [adjective paradigm charts](../../charts/1-adjectives) to familiarize yourself with the **accusative** endings in the singular and plural of each declension and adjective grouping.

Below are some further examples of transitive sentences with accusative direct objects:

* Pater **fīliam** amāvit ("The father loved his daughter.")
* Fīliī **matrēs** amant. ("The sons love their mother.")
* **Agricolam** uxor iuvābat. ("The wife was helping the farmer.")
* Fortis vir **magnum monstrum** et **terribilem serpentem** pugnābat. ("The brave man is fighting the great monster and the terrible serpent.")

Sometimes, you will want to specify the recipient of the action of the verb. For instance, in the sentence "the farmer gave the girl a pizza", the girl receives the pizza that the farmer gives. Pizza is still the **direct object** - the farmer is giving the pizza (not the girl). In this sentence, the word "girl" is an **indirect object**, the recipient of the action done by the main verb. In Latin, we signal the **indirect object** by using the **dative case**, which we usually translate as "to/for X". So in Latin "the farmer gave the girl a pizza" looks like this:

* Agricola pizzam **puellae** dedit.

Literally, the sentence is "The farmer gave a pizza **to the girl**."

Head to the [noun paradigm charts](../../charts/1-nouns) and [adjective paradigm charts](../../charts/1-adjectives) to familiarize yourself with the **dative** endings in the singular and plural of each declension and adjective grouping.

To summarize, transitive sentences must have a:
* Subject
* Active verb
* Direct object in the accusative

And sometimes have an:
* Indirect object in the dative

#### Practice Opportunity

The following noun-adjective pairs are all in the nominative case and either singular or plural. Change each pairing into the accusative and dative while maintaining the same number using the [noun paradigm charts](../../charts/1-nouns) and [adjective paradigm charts](../../charts/1-adjectives) from Module 1.

### Passive Sentences

**Passive sentences** feature a subject and, unsurprisingly, a **passive** verb. Because the subject of a passive verb is being acted upon, passive sentences do not feature a direct object. Below are some examples of simple passive sentences:

* Puella visa est. ("The girl was seen.")
* Virī captī sunt. ("The men were captured.")

Sometimes, passive sentences feature a construction known as the **ablative of agent** which tells us who performed the action of the main verb (since the subject is *receiving* the action of the verb, rather than performing it). We can recognize the **ablative of agent** by the preposition *ā/ab* followed by a noun in the **ablative case**. Below are the examples from above with an ablative of agent:

* Puella **ab matre** visa est. ("The girl was seen by her mother.")
* Virī **ā fēminīs** captī sunt. ("The men were captured by the women.")

Head to the [noun paradigm charts](../../charts/1-nouns) and [adjective paradigm charts](../../charts/1-adjectives) to familiarize yourself with the **ablative** endings in the singular and plural of each declension and adjective grouping.

Passive sentences can also feature an **indirect object** in the **dative case** as well. For example, we might see a sentence like the following:

* Pizza **puellae** data est. ("The pizza was given to the girl.")

To summarize, passive sentences must have a:
* Subject
* Passive verb

And sometimes have an:
* An ablative of agent
* Indirect object in the dative

#### Practice Opportunity

The following noun-adjective pairs are all in the nominative case and either singular or plural. Change each pairing into the ablative while maintaining the same number using the [noun paradigm charts](../../charts/1-nouns) and [adjective paradigm charts](../../charts/1-adjectives) from Module 1.

### Linking Sentences

**Linking sentences**, which we have already met, require a subject, **linking verb**, and **predicate nominative** which matches the subject in **number** and **case** and, in the case of adjectives as predicate nominatives, **gender**. The most common linking verb in English and Latin is "to be" (*sum*, *esse*, *fui*, *futurus*), though there are other linking verbs we will see throughout the semester. Below are some examples of linking sentences:

* Vir pater est. ("The man is a father.")
* Puerī magnī et fortēs sunt. ("The boys are strong and brave.")

In each of the sentences above, what is the subject, and what is the predicate nominative?  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('ex')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="ex">subjects: *vir*, *puerī*; pred. noms.: *pater*, *magnī et fortēs*</span>

To summarize, linking sentences must have a:
* Subject
* Linking verb
* Predicate nominative

## Tips for Determining Sentence Structure

The most important thing to do when determining sentence structure is to look at the **main verb**. If the verb is passive, we know that the sentence structure is going to be **passive**; if the verb is a linking verb (i.e. a form of *sum*), then we know the sentence structure is going to be **linking**. It is more difficult to differentiate between transitive and intransitive verbs. While some Latin verbs are used only transitively (verbs like "to carry") and or only intransitively (verbs like "to rain"), a large number of verbs can be used both transitively or intransitively. In these cases, you will want to see if there is a direct object in the accusative case (transitive) or not (intransitive).

### Practice Opportunity

Determine the sentence structure of the following sentences; identify any *nouns* in the accusative, dative, or ablative cases; and translate the sentence.

1. *soror mea tristis est.*  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac9')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac9">linking; "My sister is sad."</span>

2. *pulchra carmina audiēbāmus.*  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac10')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac10">transitive; *carmina* = accusative; "We were hearing beautiful songs."</span>

3. *agricolae ā nostrō duce missī sunt.*  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac11')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac11">passive; *duce* = ablative; "The farmers were sent by our leader."</span>

4. *vēnistis!*  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac12')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac12">intransitive; "You (all) have come!"</span>

5. *rex fīliō suō potestātem dedit.*  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac13')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac13">transitive; *fīliō* = dative, *potestātem* = accusative; "The king gave power to his own son."</span>
