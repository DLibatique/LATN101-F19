## Dependent Clauses

Thus far we have dealt with sentences that consist solely of **independent clauses** (i.e. a clause (a phrase consisting of a subject and verb) that can stand on its own as a separate sentence). Now we will turn our attention to sentences that contain both independent and **dependent clauses** - phrases consisting of a subject and verb that cannot stand on their own as a sentence. Dependent clauses always begin with a word (adverb, conjunction, or pronoun) which indicates that they are subordinate to and dependent on another clause in the sentence. Below are some examples of dependent clauses in English (bolded):

- **When I was in college,** I majored in Biology.
- She was a student **who excels in Latin and Math.**
- **Although the teacher was funny,** the students never laughed at his jokes.

These dependent clauses cannot stand on their own; if I were to say "When I was in college.", you'd be left wondering what happened at that time.

As we can see here, the dependent clauses add important information about the circumstances under which the action of the independent clause took place.

## Temporal Clauses

Dependent clauses can be classified by the type of information that they add about the independent clause. Dependent clauses that tell us when something occurred is called a **temporal clause**.

In Latin, temporal clauses are introduced by a **temporal conjunction** (e.g. cum = when, postquam = after, antequam = before, dum = while) and feature a subject and verb. The verb can be either in the indicative or the subjunctive in mood. If the verb is indicative the clause exactly defines the time when the action of the main clause happened (e.g. When the clock struck 6, I ate dinner). If the verb is subjunctive it tells us the circumstances under which the action of the main clause happens (e.g. While I was taking the test, I was working very hard). Below are some examples of sentence with temporal clauses.

- **Cum Hercules infans erat**, duōs serpentēs necāvit. ("When Hercules was an infant, he killed two serpents.")
- **Postquam urbem cepīssent**, milites celebravērunt. ("After they had taken the city, the soldiers celebrated.") (The dependent clause describes the circumstances under which the soldiers celebrated.)
- **Postquam urbem cēperant**, mīlitēs celebrāvērunt. ("After they had taken the city, the soldiers celebrated.") (The dependent clause explains the time when the soldiers celebrated.)
