## Dependent Clauses

Thus far we have dealt with sentences that consist solely of independent clauses (i.e. a clause that can stand on its own as a separate sentence). dependent clauses - a phrase consisting of a subject and verb that cannot stand on their own as a sentence. Dependent clauses always begin with a word (adverb, conjunction, or pronoun) which indicates that they are subordinate to and dependent on another clause in the sentence. Below are some examples of dependent clauses in English (bolded):

- **When I was in college,** I majored in Biology.
- She was a student **who excels in Latin and Math.**
