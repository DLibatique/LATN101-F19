## The Present Tense

### The Present Tense - Conceptual Overview

The **present tense** indicates that the action of a verb is happening at the same time as the speaker's utterance. For example, in the sentence "I write about the present tense", the verb "write" indicates that the process of writing is currently happening. The present tense can also show an action in progress through the use of a form of the verb "to be" and the addition of -ing to the verb; for example, "we are learning about Latin." The verb "are learning" indicates that learning is in the process of happening!

Here are some more English examples of the present tense, with the Latin equivalent of the verb in parentheses:

* She is coming (*venit*) from the market.
* An exam is being given (*datur*) by the teacher.
* He writes (*scrībit*) a letter.
* We are looking for (*petimus*) our friends.

### Formation of the Present Indicative in the 1st and 2nd Conjugations

If you need the first person singular present active indicative form of the verb, you automatically have it from the **first principal part** of the dictionary entry. For example, with the verb *amō*, *amāre*, *amāvī*, *amātus*, "to love", the first principal part, *amō*, is your first person present active indicative form, which means "I love."

To form the present indicative in the other persons and numbers in the **1st and 2nd conjugation**, we begin by finding the verb's present stem. To find it, you go to the **second principal part** of the verb's dictionary entry and then chop off the final *-re*. For example, with the same example verb, we would go to the second principal part, *amāre*, and chop off the final *-re*, which leaves us with the present stem: *amā-*.

From there, you add your personal endings, which are shown below (focus on the **bolded** third person forms for the first part of this semester):

**Active**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | (-ō)       | -mus      |
| 2nd  | -s        | -tis       |
| 3rd  | **-t**        | **-nt**     |

So, for example, the 3rd person plural present active indicative form of *amō* is *amant*, "they love." The 2nd person singular present active indicative form of *amō* is *amās*, "you love."

For the **passive** forms, you would tack on the **passive** personal endings onto your present stem (for the 1st person singular, you would tack the ending directly onto the active form):

**Passive**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -r       | -mur      |
| 2nd  | -ris        | -minī       |
| 3rd  | **-tur**        | **-ntur**     |

So, for example, the 1st person singular present passive indicative of *amō* is *amor*, "I am (being) loved." The third person singular present passive indicative of *amō* is *amātur*, "he/she/it is (being) loved."

### Present Indicative in the 3rd, 3rd -iō, and 4th Conjugations

### Practice Opportunity

From the dictionary entry, conjugate the verb in the 3rd person plural present indicative active and passive, and then translate the new form.

## The Imperfect Tense

### The Imperfect Tense - Conceptual Overview

The **imperfect tense** is one of three different past tenses (along with the perfect and pluperfect) used in Latin. In its usage in the indicative mood, the imperfect is different from the other two tenses because it connotes an ongoing, continuous, habitual, or attempted action in the past (it never refers to a completed action).

For instance, for the active form of the English verb "to make", we can translate the Latin imperfect as "was/were making" (the most common translation of the imperfect), "used to make", "kept on making", or "began to make." Similarly, for the passive form of the English verb "to make" (i.e. "to be made"), we can translate the Latin imperfect as "was/were being made", "used to be made", "kept being made", or "began to be made."

Below are some English examples where we would use the Latin imperfect (note the *-ba* infix in all the Latin form - this is the telltale sign that a verb is in the imperfect):

* When I went to the store, she was doing (*faciēbat*) her homework.
* They used to give (*dabant*) the football players free pizza on Friday.
* Although the teacher told them to stop working, the students kept writing (*scrībēbant*) their exams.
* Katie was being asked (*petēbātur*) to play Beyonce.

### Formation of the Imperfect Indicative

To form the imperfect indicative (NB: this is the same for both active and passive), we start by finding the verb's present stem. To determine the present stem, we take the second principal part (the present active infinitive) and chop off the final *-re*.

For instance, in the case of the verb, *videō*, its second principal part is *vidēre* and taking off the *-re* gives us a present stem of *vidē-*.

For verbs that belong to the first and second conjugation, we do not need to modify the present stem and can simply add *-ba* to the stem to make the imperfect stem. In the case of *videō*:

*vidēre* -> *vidē-* (present stem) -> *vidē-ba-* (imperfect stem)

For verbs that belong to the third and fourth we have to make some changes to the present stem before adding *-ba*:
- In the third conjugation, the *e* of the present stem becomes *ē*.
- In the fourth conjugation, the *ī* of the present stem becomes *iē*.
  * In the case of third -io verbs, the *e* of the present stem becomes *iē* as well.

Thus, *audīre** -> *audī-* (present stem) -> *audiē-* -> *audiē-ba-* (imperfect stem)

To this stem, we add the endings for the relevant person and number, and voice, as shown below:

**Active**

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -m       | -mus      |
| 2nd  | -s        | -tis       |
| 3rd  | **-t**        | **-nt**     |

**Passive** (NB: To move from active to passive in the imperfect, all we have to do is change personal endings.)

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -r       | -mur      |
| 2nd  | -ris        | -mini       |
| 3rd  | **-tur**        | **-ntur**     |

So if we wanted to form the 3rd person plural imperfect passive indicative of *videō*:

*vidēre* -> *vidē-* (present stem) -> *vidē-ba-* (imperfect stem) -> *vidē-ba-ntur*

## The Perfect Tense

### The Perfect Tense - Conceptual Overview

The **perfect tense** is one of three different past tenses (along with the imperfect and pluperfect) used in Latin. In its usage in the indicative mood, the perfect refers to a singular action that has been completed in the past.

For instance, for the active form of the English verb "to make", we can translate the Latin perfect as "has/have made", "did make", or simply "made." Similarly, for the passive form of the English verb "to make" (i.e. "to be made"), we can translate the Latin perfect as "has/have been made" or simply "was/were made."

Below are some English examples where we would use the Latin perfect:

* She has done (*fēcit*) her homework.
* They gave (*dedērunt*) the football players free pizza on Friday.
* The students did write (*scrīpsērunt*) their exams.
* Katie has been asked (*petīta est*) to play Beyonce.

### Formation of the Perfect Active Indicative

Unlike the imperfect, the **perfect active** and **perfect passive** are formed differently. However, in the indicative mood, both are relatively easy to create and recognize.

To form the **perfect active indicative**, we need to find the perfect active stem. To do this, we simply take the 3rd principal part and take away the final *-ī*.

For instance in the verb *videō*, the third principal part is *vīdī* and, thus, our perfect active stem is *vīd-*.

Once we have the perfect active stem, forming the perfect active indicative is simple, we just add the personal endings for the perfect to the stem:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -ī       | -īmus      |
| 2nd  | -istī        | -istis       |
| 3rd  | **-it**        | **-ērunt/-ēre**     |

NB: There are two endings that can be used for the 3rd personal plural of the perfect active indicative.

So if we wanted to form the 3rd person singular perfect active indicative of *videō*:

*vīdī* -> *vīd-* (perfect active stem) -> (add personal ending) *vīdit*  

#### Practice Opportunity

Find the perfect active stem and form the 3rd person singular perfect active for the following verbs.

### Formation of the Perfect Passive Indicative

To form the **perfect passive indicative**, we need to find the perfect passive stem. To do this, we simply take the adjectival form of 4th principal part (the reason we need the adjectival form is because the verb must agree with its subject in number and gender).

For instance in the verb *videō*, the fourth principal part is *vīsus* and thus our perfect passive stem is *vīsus*, *vīsa*, *vīsum*.

To make the perfect passive indicative, we take the perfect passive stem and add the present indicative form of "to be" (*sum*, *esse*, *fui*) that matches the person and number of the verb. In the case of *videō*, it looks like this:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | vīsus/vīsa/vīsum* sum       |  vīsī/vīsae/vīsa sumus    |
| 2nd  | vīsus/vīsa*/vīsum* es       | -vīsī/vīsae/vīsa estis       |
| 3rd  | **vīsus/vīsa/vīsum est**        | **vīsī/vīsae/vīsa sunt**     |

NB: Look at how the adjectival form changes as we go from singular to plural. Why does it happen?
