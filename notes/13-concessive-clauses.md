## Concessive Clauses

Concessive clauses are dependent clauses that indicate that the action of the dependent clause happens despite circumstances that appear to hinder it. There are a number of words that can introduce concessive clauses (quamvis, licet, quamquam, cum), which usually are translated as "although", "even thought", or "and yet." Additionally, there are certain words that appear in the independent clause, such as **tamen** ("nevertheless"), that indicate that its action are at odds with the circumstances of the dependent clause These clauses can take either the indicative or the subjunctive.

**Quamquam** always takes the indicative and introduces an admitted fact.

- Quamquam senex non fortis erat, tamen magnā sapientiā regnavit. (Although the old man was not strong, he nevertheless ruled with great wisdom.)

**Quamvis** always takes the subjunctive.

- Quamvis difficilis esset, tamen linguam Latinam facile didicit. (Although it was difficult, she nevertheless learned the Latin language easily.)


NB: Quod can be differentiated from the relative pronoun quite easily. If there is no neuter singular antecedent, then quod cannot be a pronoun.

**Quoniam** is used almost solely with the indicative to introduce a cause in the eyes of the writer or speaker.

- Quoniam puellam amat, mittere eum ad bellum nolo. (Because he loves the girl, I do not wish to send him to war.)

**Cum clauses** that feature a subjunctive verb can indicate cause. In these cases, we translate cum as "because.""

- Cum puellam amaret, fortiter pugnavit. (Because he loved the girl, he fought bravely.)

Note in the sentence above, it would not make any sense if you translate it as "when."

If there is a causal clause in indirect statement, the causal clause will always have a subjunctive verb. Can you think of reason why this might be the case?
