## Causal Clauses

Causal clauses are dependent clauses that explain why the action of the dependent clause happens. There are a number of words that can introduce causal clauses (quod, quia, quoniam, cum). These clauses can take either the indicative or the subjunctive.

**Quod** and **quia** can be used with the indicative or the subjunctive. When used with the indicative, quod and quia indicate that the stated cause is true in the eyes of the sentence's writer or speaker. They use the subjunctive to indicate that the stated cause is true in the eyes of someone who is *not* the writer or speaker.

- pācem nolō quod difficilis est. (I do not want peace because (to my mind) it is difficult.)
- pācem noluit quod difficilis esset. (He does not want peace because (to his mind) it is difficult.)

NB: Quod can be differentiated from the relative pronoun quite easily. If there is no neuter singular antecedent 

**Quoniam** is used almost solely with the indicative to indicate a cause that is true in the eye of the speaker or writer.

**Cum clauses** that feature a subjunctive verb can indicate cause. In these cases, we translate cum as because.
